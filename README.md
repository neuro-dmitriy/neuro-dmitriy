# Hi, I'm Dmitriy Lisitsyn, PhD

## Background
With a background in math, physics, and machine learning, I've spent over a decade performing (mostly) neuroscience research at various academic institutions. During this time, I've honed advanced data analysis and modeling skills, applying them to frontier problems in theoretical, cognitive, systems, and experimental neuroscience domains.

However, in my last post-doc at Dartmouth, I realized my passion lies in applying these skills to more immediate, real-world applications. It's time to peek outside the ivory tower!

## Goals
This GitHub repository is a platform for my transition journey. Its purpose is to:

- **Showcase some of my past work**: 
  - processing and analyzing an array of electrophysiology and imaging neural recordings
  - intricate psychophysics experiments
  - new algorithms for information theory and spectral decomposition of time-series and imaging data

- **Learn and Experiment**:
  - catch up on all that LLM hype
  - play around with transformers, with particular interest in the ones implementing selective attention, e.g. Sparse Transformer and Longformer
 
- **Showcase some classic data science projects**:
  - It's time to Kaggle

Let's go!

## Connect

Reach out to me for collaboration, feedback, or just a chat about neuroscience, AI, singularity, academia, transformers, philosophy, ethics, etc.
